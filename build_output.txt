Potential fix: Your 
project's KGP version 
is typically defined 
in the plugins block 
of the 
`settings.gradle` 
file (C:\Users\lenovo\
AndroidStudioProjects\
kisan_mitra\android/se
ttings.gradle), by a 
plugin with the id of 
org.jetbrains.kotlin.a
ndroid. 
If you don't see a 
plugins block, your 
project was likely 
created with an older 
template version, in 
which case it is most 
likely defined in the 
top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\
Users\lenovo\AndroidSt
udioProjects\kisan_mit
ra\android/build.gradl
e) by the 
ext.kotlin_version 
property.
